            * Hello child. I am Toriel. I will be your guide for this section
            where I will tell you all about how this game is played.
            Unfortunately (to avoid spoilers) I cannot reveal much but please
            listen anyway. Please use the buttons to the left to navigate.

            Undertale is stylised in 2D so the basic controls are the arrow keys
            to move around. You will be able to check your stats in game and
            these will change as your LV increases. You have 2 main stats,
            <abbr title="Attack">ATK</abbr> and
            <abbr title="Defence">DEF</abbr>. As most games have, there will be
            save points in many areas which appear as little yellow stars. To
            save, press enter and navigate the menu that appears.

            <u>Encounters</u>
            <br>
            <br>
            In an encounter, during your turn, you will enter a menu which will
            show multiple things. The four basic actions are FIGHT, ACT, ITEM
            and MERCY. When FIGHT is pressed, select the monster to attack and
            time your attacks (closer to the centre means higher damage). When
            ACT is pressed, select the monster. Every monster comes with
            different actions and sometimes this can have an effect on the
            battle. When ITEM is pressed, any item that is currently in your
            inventory can be selected and used. MERCY can be used to run away or
            spare a monster. However this can only be done when their name is
            highlighted in yellow. The name can be yellow from the start of the
            battle or can become yellow after doing certain actions.

            <u>Items</u>
            <br>
            <br>
            There are a variety of items that you can find in areas throughout
            the game. There are a large amount of "food" items that will give
            you health if they are used in an encounter. Do remember these will
            use up a turn. Also there are quite a few items that can be equipped
            to help you fight. All of these are listed in the table below

            There are 5 main areas within the game: Ruins, Snowdin, Waterfall,
            Hotland and the Core. Each area has a different theme and a
            different set of monsters. As in any game the difficulty of the
            monsters will increase as you go through but you should be fine as
            the gameplay is designed so that it should not be too hard for you
            to get through.

          <p>
            Undertale has 3 different endings depending on playstyle:
            <span class="paci">Pacifist</span>,
            <span class="neut">Neutral</span> and
            <span class="geno">Genocide</span>. These are based on how you fight
            monsters in the game and, as the names suggest, how many you kill.
            To avoid as many spoilers as possible I will not go into detail
            about the endings, but I will give the requirements for each ending.
            The easiest one to do is the
            <span class="paci">Neutral</span> ending. Just play through th game
            normally and you should get this ending. The
            <span class="geno">Genocide</span> ending can be done without
            previous playthroughs and the requirement is to kill all the
            monsters in a specific area of the game. You must continually try to
            encounter monsters and eventually the encounter image will change
            into a smiley face. Also, whenever you save there will be a counter
            showing how many monsters are left. The route can be aborted at any
            time by sparing a monster. The
            <span class="paci">Pacifist</span> ending, can only be done after a
            full playthrough of the game. To do this you must spare every single
            monster you come across without ever gaining EXP.
