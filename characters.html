            Frisk is the playable character and main protagonist of the game.
            After Frisk falls into the Underground, they go on a journey to
            return to the surface. Frisk is the eighth and final human to fall
            into the Underground after travelling to Mount Ebott.
            <br>
            <br>
            Depending on the actions they take, Frisk can be seen as merciful
            and kind or merciless and violent. Some NPCs highlight Frisk's
            kindness, understanding, and grace at the end of the game. Frisk
            will always listen and only prevents player input when they follow
            another characters' instructions, such as when Sans tells them to
            hide behind the conveniently-shaped lamp.

            ASGORE is a kind and quiet, often upbeat monster who enjoys
            gardening. Before he fights the protagonist, he allows them
            to finish any tasks left in the Underground and seems quite 
            reluctant to fight. His goal is to gain enough human souls to
            break the barrier and allow monsters to leave the Underground.
